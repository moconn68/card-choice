# Card Choice Date Night

This application was created to mimic the recently popular online trend of deciding a date's activities via one person writing two ideas at a time on index cards, and having their partner blindly pick one of the two as the next activity. This repeats for as long as the date, event, etc lasts.

## Purpose

This project aims to create a simple and fun interface for the above trend. While the trend is sometimes done seriously and sometimes done in jest (ie unbeknownst to the one selecting a card, both have chores written on it), I see real merit in creating a spontaneous and fun date night, family day, or hangout with friends. Thus, I hope this applicaiton serves this end, and in the form of software is able to make this activity easy to engage in, available anywhere, and serve to easily generate a large number of meaningful choices for fun activities.
